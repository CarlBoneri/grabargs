# grabargs

A very small package with only one real purpose: to import the `grab_args` function
into any package or *Shiny App*. I got tired of importing this function into all my
private packages, so deploying as a package itself. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of grabargs from [GitHub](https://github.com/CarlBoneri/grabargs) with:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("CarlBoneri/grabargs")
```

## Why this function is helpful  

Let's say you have a function with a ton of optional arguments. A good example is 
when building an **API** and the query params are mostly optional. Let's use twitter
as an example for [searching tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets).

I'm not in the mood to write out all the params, so let's parse the doc:

```{r paged.print=TRUE}
library(xml2)

raw_page <- xml2::read_html("https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets")

params_table <- xml_find_all(raw_page, ".//h2[contains(.,'Parameters')]//following-sibling::table") %>%
  rvest::html_table() %>% .[[1]] %>%  dplyr::rename_all(function(x){
    tolower(x) %>% gsub("(\\s+)", "_", ., perl = TRUE)
  })

# The description column is making this thing wrap way too much, so gonna truncate:
# 
params_table$description <- lapply(params_table$description, function(i){
    r <- stri_split_regex(i, "(?<=\\.|\\!|\\?)(\\s+)") %>% unlist()
    if(length(r) > 1){
        stri_join(r[1:2], collapse = " ")
    }else {
        r
    }
}) %>% unlist

knitr::kable(params_table %>% select(-default_value), align = "l")
```


---

So our function would want to allow the user to pass all the params, but testing for each would be a pain, because
there are `r nrow(params_table)` possible params. For instance:

```{r}
params_table$name
```

Here's what our function would look like if we did have to check for each 
**(please note this is an example, we would need to check for auth tokens etc in a real scenario, and that httr will actually drop NULL values in query lists)**:

```{r}
t.search_test <- function(q = NULL, geocode = NULL, lang = NULL, locale = NULL, result_type = c("mixed", "recent", "popular"), 
                          count = 100, until = NULL, since_id = NULL, max_id = NULL, include_entities = FALSE){
  
  # Notice we have to build a full list of objects and perform another step cleaning...
  query <- list(q = q, geocode = geocode, lang = lang, locale = locale, result_type = match.arg(result_type),
                count = count, until = until, since_id = since_id, max_id = max_id, include_entities = include_entities)
  
  query <- query[!mapply(is.null, query)]
  
  query
}

t.search_test()

```

*VS*

```{r include=FALSE}
source("R/grab_args.R")
```

```{r}
t.search_test2 <- function(q = NULL, geocode = NULL, lang = NULL, locale = NULL, result_type = c("mixed", "recent", "popular"), 
                           count = 100, until = NULL, since_id = NULL, max_id = NULL, include_entities = FALSE){
  
  query <- grab_args_clean()
  
  
  query
  
}
t.search_test2()
```

As you can see this has shortened our manual process greatly, as well as given us a cleaner approach.
